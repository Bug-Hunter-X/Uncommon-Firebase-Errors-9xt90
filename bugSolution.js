To solve the "Error: Invalid data. Data must be an object, but it was: undefined" error, ensure that the data you are providing to Firebase is a valid JSON object. You can use JSON.stringify() to convert your data into a JSON string before sending it to Firebase.

To solve the "auth/user-not-found" error, ensure that the email and password you are providing are correct and that the user account exists. You can also use Firebase Authentication's user management features to create new users or manage existing ones.
